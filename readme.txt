Program description

This software lets you activate Microsoft Windows via a custom KMS server.
Please use it for non-commercial home purposes only.

Important remark

This software needs admin rights for correct work. Run it as an admin.

Product key

The volume license is the best choice because it doesn't have problems with the activation. Use the volume license if possible.
You need to apply the product key from the volume license before activation if you have an ordinary license.
You can see these keys here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/get-started/kmsclientkeys

Troubleshooting guide

Try to change the server or product key if you have trouble with activation.

Server list

Edit the servers.txt file to add or remove the server from the server list.
